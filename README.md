The model uses several popular classification algorithms implemented through scikit-learn, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Each algorithm is evaluated based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
